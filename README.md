# what is our mission?
 This is the rea line project, which means we only have seven hours to make a one page website for the company who has not very good website. I got the one for the docter.
 i first design the basic layout for the doctor web, and then i use my own framework for my previous project call jassassy.
 during this misson, i prove my framework accutually woring ,but i also found the following froblem of my framework.
 1. the varible for color should use primary or secondery instead of blur pink, because if you want to reuse them, it get comfused.
 1. should not give my mixin row and width.
 1. mixin bg doesnt always work.
 1. should give @media a variable.
 
 The original [website](http://www.huisartsdebruyker.be/index.html).
 

## Problem of the original website
 1. No high light information.
 1. Hard to located the information you need.
 1. No modern design.
 1. font size is too small.
 1. outdate nav bar.
 
 ## How do i improve?
 1. Organize information
2.Sort by the importance of the information
3.Using tables to make content more readable 
4.Choose a layout and color theme that  fits better doctor
5.Delete the skyline image that did not match the content of the website, and replace it with an electrocardiogram
6. Design the site using flat design which is much modern.


 ## what i have changed?
 1. layout.
 i designed an organized layout which contain the following information:
 - The doctor name;
 - Genaral information;
 - Opening hours;
 - Location;
 - Review for the patien;
 1. color.
 i change the color theme to blue,so that give people the feeling of Clean and wise.
 1. review.
 The reason i did that is the doctor is very old and have no social media that ppl can know more info from him, the review form patient can build a better impression for the doctor.
