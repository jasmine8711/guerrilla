# Website design for Dr. Bart De Bruyker
[De Keizer](https://jasmine8711.github.io/guerrilla/)

The original [website](http://www.huisartsdebruyker.be/index.html).

##Problem of the original website
 1. No high light information.
 1. Hard to located the information you need.
 1. No modern design.

 ##what i have changed?
 1. layout.
 i designed an organized layout which contain the following information:
 - The doctor name;
 - Genaral information;
 - Opening hours;
 - Location;
 - Review for the patien;
 1. color.
 i change the color theme to blue,so that give people the feeling of Clean and wise.
 1. review.
 The reason i did that is the doctor is very old and have no social media that ppl can know more info from him, the review form patient can build a better impression for the doctor.
